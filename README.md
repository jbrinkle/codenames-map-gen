# CODENAMES Map Generator

Codenames is a popular game by Czech Games ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Czech-Games-00031CGE-Codenames/dp/B014Q1XX9S/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=codenames&qid=1592932962&sr=8-2)). There are a number of variations on the game available for purchase. This project is a map, or key, generator for customizing game play.

This is an educational endeavor. I needed a way to practice some React development.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
